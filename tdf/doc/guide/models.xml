<chapter id="models-of-the-tdf-algebra">
	<title>Models of the &tdf; algebra</title>

	<para>&tdf; is a multi-sorted abstract algebra. Any implementation of &tdf;
		is a model of this algebra, formed by a mapping of the algebra into a
		concrete machine. An algebraic mapping gives a concrete representation
		to each of the SORTs in such a way that the representation of any
		construction of &tdf; is independent of context; it is a homomorphism.
		In other words if we define the mapping of a &tdf; constructor, C, as
		MAP[C] and the representation of a SORT, S, as REPR[S] then:</para>

	<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[C(P1, ..., Pn)] = MAP[C](REPR(P1), ..., REPR(Pn))</programlisting>

	<para>Any mapping has to preserve the equivalences of the abstract algebra,
		such as those exemplified by the transformations {A} - {Z} in
		<link linkend="transformations-as-definitions">section 11.1</link>.
		Similarly, the mappings of any predicates on the constructions, such
		as those giving "well-formed" conditions, must be satisfied in terms
		of the mapped representations.</para>

	<para>In common with most homomorphisms, the mappings of constructions
		can exhibit more equivalences than are given by the abstract algebra.
		The use of these extra equivalences is the basis of most of the
		target-dependent optimisations in a &tdf; translator; it can make use of
		"idioms" of the target architecture to produce equivalent
		constructions which may work faster than the "obvious" translation. In
		addition, we may find that may find that more predicates are satisfied
		in a mapping than would be in the abstract algebra. a particular
		concrete mapping might allow more constructions to be well-formed than
		are permitted in the abstract; a producer can use this fact to target
		its output to a particular class of architectures. in this case, the
		producer should produce tdf so that any translator not targeted to
		this class can fail gracefully.</para>

	<para>giving a complete mapping for a particular architecture here is
		tantamount to writing a complete translator. however, the mappings for
		the small but important sub-algebra concerned with offsets and
		alignments illustrates many of the main principles.  what follows is
		two sets of mappings for disparate architectures; the first gives a
		more or less standard meaning to alignments but the second may be less
		familiar.</para>

	<section id="model-for-32bit-architecture">
		<title>Model for a 32-bit standard architecture</title>

		<para>Almost all current architectures use a "flat-store" model of
			memory. There is no enforced segregation of one kind of data from
			another - in general, one can access one unit of memory as a linear
			offset from any other. Here, &tdf; ALIGNMENTs are a reflection of
			constraints for the efficient access of different kinds of data
			objects - usually one finds that 32-bit integers are most
			efficiently accessed if they start at 32 bit boundaries and so
			on.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Alignment model</title>

			<para>The representation of ALIGNMENT in a typical standard
				architecture is a single integer where:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[{ }] = 1
REPR[{bitfield}] = 1
REPR[{char_variety}] = 8
REPR[{short_variety}] = 16</programlisting>
            
			<para>Otherwise, for all other primitive ALIGNMENTS a:</para>
            
			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[{a}] = 32</programlisting>
            
			<para>The representation of a compound ALIGNMENT is given by:</para>
            
			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[A xc8 B] = Max(REPR[A], REPR[B])
i.e. MAP[unite_alignment] = Max</programlisting>
            
			<para>while the ALIGNMENT inclusion predicate is given by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[A ... B]= REPR[A] xb3 REPR[B]</programlisting>

			<para>All the constructions which make ALIGNMENTs are represented here
				and they will always reduce to an integer known at translate-time.
				Note that the mappings for xc8 and ... must preserve the basic
				algebraic properties derived from sets; for example the mapping of
				xc8 must be idempotent, commutative and associative, which is true
				for Max.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="offset-and-pointer-model">
			<title>Offset and pointer model</title>

			<para>Most standard architectures use byte addressing; to address
				bits requires more complication. Hence, a value with SHAPE
				POINTER(A) where REPR[A)]xb9 1 is represented by a 32-bit byte
				address.</para>

			<para>We are not allowed to construct pointers where REPR[A] = 1,
				but we still have offsets whose second alignment is a bitfield.
				Thus a offsets to bitfield are represented differently to offsets
				to other alignments:</para>

			<para>A value with SHAPE OFFSET(A, B) where REPR(B) xb9 1 is
				represented by a 32-bit byte-offset.</para>

			<para>A value with SHAPE OFFSET(A, B) where REPR(B) = 1 is
				represented by a 32-bit bit-offset.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="size-model">
			<title>Size model</title>

			<para>In principle, the representation of a SHAPE is a pair of an
				ALIGNMENT and a size, given by shape_offset applied to the SHAPE.
				This pair is constant which can be evaluated at translate time.
				The construction, shape_offset(S), has SHAPE OFFSET(alignment(s),
				{ }) and hence is represented by a bit-offset:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[shape_offset(top())] = 0
REPR[shape_offset(integer(char_variety))] = 8
REPR[shape_offset(integer(short_variety))] = 16
.... etc. for other numeric varieties
REPR[shape_offset(pointer(A))]= 32
REPR[shape_offset(compound(E))] = REPR[E]
REPR[shape_offset(bitfield(bfvar_bits(b, N)))] = N
REPR[shape_offset(nof(N, S))] = N * REPR[offset_pad(alignment(S), shape_offset(S))]
        where S is not a bitfield shape</programlisting>
            
			<para>Similar considerations apply to the other offset-arithmetic
				constructors. In general, we have:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">
REPR[offset_zero(A)] = 0             for all A

REPR[offset_pad(A, X:OFFSET(C, D)) =
    ((REPR[X] + REPR[A] - 1) / (REPR[A])) * REPR[A] / 8
        if REPR[A] xb9 1 xd9 REPR[D] =1</programlisting>

			<para>Otherwise:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">
REPR[offset_pad(A, X:OFFSET(C, D)) =
    ((REPR[X] + REPR[A] - 1) / (REPR[A])) * REPR[A]

REPR[offset_add(X:OFFSET(A, B), Y:OFFSET(C, D))] = REPR[X] * 8 + REPR[Y]
        if REPR[B] xb9 1 xd9 REPR[D] = 1</programlisting>

            <para>Otherwise:</para>

            <programlisting language="tdf">
REPR[offset_add(X, Y)] = REPR[X] + REPR[Y]

REPR[offset_max(X:OFFSET(A, B), Y:OFFSET(C, D))] = Max(REPR[X], 8 * REPR[Y]
        if REPR[B] = 1 xd9 REPR[D] xb9 1
REPR[offset_max(X:OFFSET(A, B), Y:OFFSET(C, D))] = Max(8 * REPR[X], REPR[Y]
        if REPR[D] = 1 xd9 REPR[B] xb9 1</programlisting>

			<para>Otherwise:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">
REPR[offset_max(X, Y)] = Max(REPR[X], REPR[Y])

REPR[offset_mult(X, E)] = REPR[X] * REPR[E]</programlisting>

			<para>A translator working to this model maps ALIGNMENTs into the
				integers and their inclusion constraints into numerical
				comparisons.  As a result, it will correctly allow many OFFSETs
				which are disallowed in general; for example, OFFSET({pointer},
				{char_variety}) is allowed since REPR[{pointer}] xb3
				REPR[{char_variety}]. Rather fewer of these extra relationships
				are allowed in the next model considered.</para>

		<title>Model for machines like the iAPX-432</title>

		<para>The iAPX-432 does not have a linear model of store. The address
			of a word in store is a pair consisting of a block-address and a
			displacement within that block. In order to take full advantage of
			the protection facilities of the machine, block-addresses are
			strictly segregated from scalar data like integers, floats,
			displacements etc. There are at least two different kind of blocks,
			one which can only contain block-addresses and the other which
			contains only scalar data. There are clearly difficulties here in
			describing data-structures which contain both pointers and scalar
			data.</para>

		<para>Let us assume that the machine has bit-addressing to avoid the
			bit complications already covered in the first model. Also assume
			that instruction blocks are just scalar blocks and that block
			addresses are aligned on 32-bit boundaries.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Alignment model</title>

			<para>An ALIGNMENT is represented by a pair consisting of an
				integer, giving the natural alignments for scalar data, and
				boolean to indicate the presence of a block-address. Denote this
				by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">(s:alignment_of_scalars, b:has_blocks)</programlisting>
            
			<para>We then have:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">
REPR[alignment({ })] = (s:1, b:FALSE)
REPR[alignment({char_variety}) = (s:8, b:FALSE)
... etc. for other numerical and bitfield varieties.
REPR[alignment({pointer})] = (s:32, b:TRUE)
REPR[alignment({proc})] = (s:32, b:TRUE)
REPR[alignment({local_label_value})] = (s:32, b:TRUE)</programlisting>

			<para>The representation of a compound ALIGNMENT is given by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[A xc8 B] = (s:Max(REPR[A].s, REPR[B].s), b:REPR[A].b xda REPR[B].b)</programlisting>
		  
			<para>and their inclusion relationship is given by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[A ... B] = (REPR[A].s xb3 REPR[B].s) xd9 (REPR[A].b xda REPR[B].b)</programlisting>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Offset and pointer model</title>

			<para>A value with SHAPE POINTER A where REPR[A].b is represented
				by a pair consisting of a block-address of a scalar block and an
				integer bit-displacement within that block.  Denote this by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">(sb:scalar_block_address, sd:bit_displacement)</programlisting>

			<para>A value with SHAPE POINTER A where REPR[A].b is represented by a
				quad word consisting of two block-addresses and two
				bit-displacements within these blocks. One of these block
				addresses will contain the scalar information pointed at by one of
				the bit-displacements; similarly, the other pair will point at the
				block addresses in the data are held. Denote this by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">(sb:scalar_block_address, ab:address_block_address,
 sd:scalar_displacement, ad:address_displacement)</programlisting>

			<para>A value with SHAPE OFFSET(A, B) where REPR[A].b is represented
				by an integer bit-displacement.</para>

			<para>A value with SHAPE OFFSET(A, B) where REPR[A].b is represented
				by a pair of bit-displacements, one relative to a scalar-block and
				the other to an address-block. Denote this by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">(sd:scalar_displacement, ad:address_displacement)</programlisting>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Size model</title>

			<para>The sizes given by shape_offset are now:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[shape_offset(integer(char_variety))] = 8

		<para>Unlike the previous one, this model of ALIGNMENTs would reject

		<para>but:</para>

		<programlisting language="tdf">REPR[{pointer} ... {long_variety}] = TRUE</programlisting>

		<para>This just reflects the fact that there is no way that one can
			extract a block-address necessary for a pointer from a
			scalar-block, but since the representation of a pointer includes a
			scalar displacement, one can always retrieve a scalar from a
			pointer to a pointer.</para>

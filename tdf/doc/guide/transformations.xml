	<title>&tdf; transformations</title>

	<para>&tdf; to &tdf; transformations form the basis of most of the tools of
		&tdf;, including translators. &tdf; has a rich set of easily performed
		transformations; this is mainly due to its algebraic nature, the
		liberality of its sequencing rules, and the ease with which one can
		introduce new names over limited scopes. For example, a translator is
		always free to transform:</para>

	<programlisting language="tdf">assign(e1, e2)</programlisting>

	<para>to:</para>

	<programlisting language="tdf">identify(empty, new_tag, e1, assign(obtain_tag(new_tag), e2))</programlisting>

	<para>i.e. identify the evaluation of the left-hand side of the assignment
		with a new TAG and use that TAG as the left-hand operand of a new
		assignment in the body of the identification. Note that the reverse
		transformation is only valid if the evaluation of e1 does not
		side-effect the evaluation of e2. A producer would have had to use the
		second form if it wished to evaluate e1 before e2.  The definition of
		assign allows its operands to be evaluated in any order while identify
		insists that the evaluation of its <code>definition</code> is
		conceptually complete before starting on its <code>body</code>.</para>

	<para>Why would a translator wish to make the more complicated form from
		the simpler one? This would usually depend on the particular forms of
		e1 and e2 as well as the machine idioms available for implementing the
		assignment. If, for example, the joint evaluation of e1 and e2 used
		more evaluation registers than is available, the transformation is
		probably a good idea. It would not necessarily commit one to putting
		the new tag value into the stack; some other more global criteria
		might lead one to allocate it into a register disjoint from the
		evaluation registers. In general, this kind of transformation is used
		to modify the operands of &tdf; constructions so that the
		code-production phase of the translator can just "churn the handle"
		knowing that the operands are already in the correct form for the
		machine idioms.</para>

	<para>Transformations like this are also used to give optimisations
		which are largely independent of the target architecture. In general,
		provided that the sequencing rules are not violated, any EXP
		construction, F(X), say, where X is some inner EXP, can be replaced
		by:</para>

	<programlisting language="tdf">identify(empty, new_tag, X, F(obtain_tag(new_tag))).</programlisting>

	<para>This includes the extraction of expressions which are constant over a
		loop; if F was some repeat construction and one can show that the EXP
		X is invariant over the repeat, the transformation does the constant
		extraction.</para>

	<para>Most of the transformations performed by translators are of the
		above form, but there are many others. Particular machine idioms might
		lead to transformations like changing a test (i&gt;=1) to (i&gt;0)
		because the test against zero is faster; replacing multiplication by a
		constant integer by shifts and adds because multiplication is slow;
		and so on. Target independent transformations include things like
		procedure inlining and loop unrolling. Often these target independent
		transformations can be profitably done in terms of the TOKENs of an
		&lpi;; loop unrolling is an obvious example.</para>

		<title>Transformations as definitions</title>

		<para>As well being a vehicle for expressing optimisation, &tdf;
			transformations can be used as the basis for defining &tdf;. In
			principle, if we were to define all of the allowable transformations
			of the &tdf; constructions, we would have a complete definition of &tdf;
			as the initial model of the &tdf; algebra. This would be a fairly
			impracticable project, since the totality of the rules including all
			the simple constructs would be very unwieldy, difficult to check for
			inconsistencies and would not add much illumination to the
			definition. However, knowledge of allowable transformations of &tdf;
			can often answer questions of the meaning of diverse constructs by
			relating them to a single construct. What follows is an alphabet of
			generic transformations which can often help to answer knotty
			questions.  Here, E[X \ Y] denotes an EXP E with all internal
			occurrences of X replaced by Y.</para>

		<title>Examples of transformations</title>

		<para>Any of these transformations may be performed by the &tdf;
			translators. The most important is probably {A} which allows one
			to reduce all of the EXP operands of suitable constructors to
			obtain_tags. The expansion rules for identification, {G}, {H} and
			{I}, gives definition to complicated operands as well as strangely
			formed ones, e.g. return(...  return(X)...). Rule {A} also
			illustrates neatly the lack of ordering constraints on the
			evaluation of operands. For example, mult(et, exp1, exp2) could be
			expanded by applications of {A} to either:</para>

		<programlisting language="tdf">identify(empty, t1, exp1, identify(empty, t2, exp2, mult(et, obtain_tag(t1), obtain_tag(t2))))</programlisting>

		<para>or:</para>

		<programlisting language="tdf">identify(empty, t2, exp2, identify(empty, t1, exp1, mult(et, obtain_tag(t1), obtain_tag(t2))))</programlisting>

		<para>Both orderings of the evaluations of exp1 and exp2 are acceptable,
			regardless of any side-effects in them. There is no requirement
			that both expansions should produce the same answer for the
			multiplications; the only person who can say whether either result
			is "wrong" is the person who specified the program.</para>

		<para>Many of these transformations often only come into play when
			some previous transformation reveals some otherwise hidden
			information. For example, after procedure in-lining given by {U}
			or loop un-rolling given by {S}, a translator can often deduce the
			behaviour of a _test constructor, replacing it by either a
			make_top or a goto. This may allow one to apply either {J} or {H}
			to eliminate dead code in sequences and in turn {N} or {P} to
			eliminate entire conditions and so on.</para>

		<para>Application of transformations can also give expansions which
			are rather pathological in the sense that a producer is very
			unlikely to form them. For example, a procedure which returns no
			result would have result statements of the form
			return(make_top()). In-lining such a procedure by {U} would have a
			form like:</para>

		<programlisting language="tdf">variable(empty, nt, make_shape(TOP),
         labelled((L),
         ... sequence((assign(obtain_tag(nt), make_top())),
goto(L)) ...
         contents(TOP, obtain_tag(nt))
         )
)</programlisting>

			<para>The rules {V}, {W} and {X} allow this to be replaced by:</para>

			<programlisting language="tdf">variable(empty, nt, make_top(),
         labelled((L),
         ... sequence((obtain_tag(nt)), goto(L)) ...
         sequence((obtain_tag(nt)), make_top())
         )
)</programlisting>
  
		<para>The obtain_tags can be eliminated by rule {M} and then the
			sequences by {F}. Sucessive applications of {C} and {B} then give:</para>

		<programlisting language="tdf">labelled((L),
         ... goto(L) ...
         make_top()
        )</programlisting>

	<section>
		<title>Programs with undefined values</title>
	
		<para>The definitions of most of the constructors in the &tdf;
			specification are predicated by some conditions; if these
			conditions are not met the effect and result of the constructor is
			not defined for all possible platforms.  <footnote>
				<para>However, we may find that the mapping of a constraint
					allows extra relationships for a class of architectures which
					do not hold in all generality; this may mean that some
					constructions are defined on this class while still being
					undefined in others (see
					<link linkend="models-of-the-tdf-algebra">section 13</link>).</para>
			</footnote>
			Any value which is dependent on the effect or result of an
			undefined construction is also undefined. This is not the same as
			saying that a program is undefined if it can construct an
			undefined value - the dynamics of the program might be such that
			the offending construction is never obeyed.</para>

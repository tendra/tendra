		<title>The Basic Encoding</title>

		<para>TDF consists of a sequence of 8-bit bytes used to encode integers of a
			varying number of bits, from 1 to 32. These integers will be called basic
			integers.</para>

		<para>TDF is encoded into bytes in increasing byte index, and within the byte
			the most significant end is filled before the least significant.	Let the
			bits within a byte be numbered from 0 to 7, 0 denoting the least
			significant bit and 7 the most significant. Suppose that the bytes up to
			<replaceable>n</replaceable>-1 have been filled and that the next free bit in
			byte <replaceable>n</replaceable> is bit <replaceable>k</replaceable>. Then bits
			<replaceable>k</replaceable>+1 to 7 are full and bits 0 to
			<replaceable>k</replaceable> remain to be used. Now an integer of
			<replaceable>d</replaceable> bits is to be appended.</para>

		<para>If <replaceable>d</replaceable> is less than or equal to <replaceable>k</replaceable>,
			the <replaceable>d</replaceable> bits will occupy bits
			<replaceable>k</replaceable>-<replaceable>d</replaceable>+1 to <replaceable>k</replaceable>
			of byte <replaceable>n</replaceable>, and the next free bit will be at bit
			<replaceable>k-d</replaceable>. Bit 0 of the integer will be at bit
			<replaceable>k</replaceable>-<replaceable>d</replaceable>+1 of the byte, and bit
			<replaceable>d</replaceable>-1 of the integer will be at bit
			<replaceable>k</replaceable>.</para>

		<para>If <replaceable>d</replaceable> is equal to <replaceable>k</replaceable>+1, the
			<replaceable>d</replaceable> bits will occupy bits 0 to <replaceable>k</replaceable>
			of byte <replaceable>n</replaceable> and the next free bit will be bit 7 of byte
			<replaceable>n</replaceable>+1. Bit <replaceable>d</replaceable>-1 of the integer will
			be at bit <replaceable>k</replaceable> of the byte.</para>

		<para>If <replaceable>d</replaceable> is greater than <replaceable>k</replaceable>+1, the
			most significant <replaceable>k</replaceable>+1 bits of the integer will be in
			byte <replaceable>n</replaceable>, with bit <replaceable>d</replaceable>-1 at bit
			<replaceable>k</replaceable> of the byte. The remaining
			<replaceable>d</replaceable>-<replaceable>k</replaceable>-1 least significant bits are
			then encoded into the bytes, starting at byte <replaceable>n</replaceable>+1,
			bit 7, using the same algorithm (i.e. recursively).</para>

		<title>Fundamental encodings</title>

		<para>This section describes the encoding of <code>TDFINT</code>,
			<code>TDFBOOL</code>, <code>TDFSTRING</code>, <code>TDFIDENT</code>,
			<code>BITSTREAM</code>, <code>BYTESTREAM</code>, <code>BYTE_ALIGN</code>
			and extendable integers.</para>

		<section id="TDFINT-encoding">
			<title>TDFINT</title>

			<para><code>TDFINT</code> encodes non-negative integers of unbounded size. The
				encoding uses octal digits encoded in 4-bit basic integers.	The most
				significant octal digit is encoded first, the least significant last.
				For all digits except the last the 4-bit integer is the value of the
				octal digit. For the last digit the 4-bit integer is the value of the
				octal digit plus 8.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="TDFBOOL-encoding">
			<title>TDFBOOL</title>

			<para><code>TDFBOOL</code> encodes a boolean, true or false.	The encoding
				uses a 1-bit basic integer, with 1 encoding true and 0 encoding false.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="TDFSTRING-encoding">
			<title>TDFSTRING</title>

			<para><code>TDFSTRING</code> encodes a sequence containing
				<replaceable>n</replaceable> non-negative integers, each of
				<replaceable>k</replaceable> bits. The encoding consists of, first a
				<code>TDFINT</code> giving the number of bits, second a
				<code>TDFINT</code> giving the number of integers, which may be zero.
				Thirdly it contains <replaceable>n</replaceable> <replaceable>k</replaceable>-bit
				basic integers, giving the sequence of integers required, the first
				integer being first in this sequence.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="TDFIDENT-encoding">
			<title>TDFIDENT</title>

			<para><code>TDFIDENT</code> also encodes a sequence containing
				<replaceable>n</replaceable> non-negative integers. These integers will all
				consist of the same number of bits, which will be a multiple of 8. It is
				a property of the encoding of the other constructions that TDFIDENTS
				will start on either bit 7 or bit 3 of a byte and end on bit 7 or bit 3
				of a byte. It thus has some alignment properties which are useful to
				permit fast copying of sections of TDF.</para>

			<para>The encoding consists of, first a <code>TDFINT</code> giving the number
				of bits, second a <code>TDFINT</code> giving the number of integers,
				which may be zero. If the next free bit is not bit 7 of some byte, it is
				moved on to bit 7 of the next byte.</para>

			<para>Thirdly it contains <replaceable>n</replaceable> <replaceable>k</replaceable>-bit
				integers.</para>

			<para>If the next free bit is not bit 7 of some byte, it is moved on to bit 7
				of the next byte.</para>

	<section id="BITSTREAM-encoding">
		<title>BITSTREAM</title>

		<para>It can be useful to be able to skip a TDF construction without reading
			through it. <code>BITSTREAM</code> provides a means of doing this.</para>

		<para>A <code>BITSTREAM</code> encoding of <replaceable>X</replaceable> consists of a
			<code>TDFINT</code> giving the number of bits of encoding which are
			occupied by the <replaceable>X</replaceable>.	Hence to skip over a
			<code>BITSTREAM</code> while decoding, one should read the
			<code>TDFINT</code> and then advance the bit index by that number of bits.
			To read the contents of a <code>BITSTREAM</code> encoding of
			<replaceable>X</replaceable>, one should read and ignore a <code>TDFINT</code>
			and then decode an <replaceable>X</replaceable>. There will be no spare bits at
			the end of the <replaceable>X</replaceable>, so reading can continue directly.</para>

		<section id="BYTESTREAM-encoding">
			<title>BYTESTREAM</title>

			<para>It can be useful to be able to skip a TDF construction without reading
				through it. <code>BYTESTREAM</code> provides a means of doing this while
				remaining byte aligned, so facilitating copying the TDF. A
				<code>BYTESTREAM</code> will always start when the bit position is 3 or
				7.</para>

			<para>A <code>BYTESTREAM</code> encoding of <replaceable>X</replaceable> starts with
				a <code>TDFINT</code> giving a number, <replaceable>n</replaceable>. After
				this, if the current bit position is not bit 7 of some byte, it is moved
				to bit 7 of the next byte.	The next <replaceable>n</replaceable> bytes are an
				encoding of <replaceable>X</replaceable>. There may be some spare bits left
				over at the end of <replaceable>X</replaceable>.</para>

			<para>Hence to skip over a <code>BYTESTREAM</code> while decoding one should
				read a <code>TDFINT</code>, <replaceable>n</replaceable>, move to the next
				byte alignment (if the bit position is not 7) and advance the bit index
				over <replaceable>n</replaceable> bytes. To read a <code>BYTESTREAM</code>
				encoding of <replaceable>X</replaceable> one should read a
				<code>TDFINT</code>, <replaceable>n</replaceable>, and move to the next byte,
				<replaceable>b</replaceable> (if the bit position is not 7), and then decode
				an <replaceable>X</replaceable>. Finally the bit position should be moved to
				<replaceable>n</replaceable> bytes after <replaceable>b</replaceable>.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="BYTE_ALIGN-encoding">
			<title>BYTE_ALIGN</title>

			<para><code>BYTE_ALIGN</code> leaves the bit position alone if it is 7, and
				otherwise moves to bit 7 of the next byte.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="extendable-integer-encoding">
			<title>Extendable integer encoding</title>

			<para>A <replaceable>d</replaceable>-bit extendable integer encoding enables an
				integer greater than zero to be encoded given <replaceable>d</replaceable>, a
				number of bits.</para>

			<para>If the integer is between 1 and
				2<superscript><replaceable>d</replaceable></superscript> - 1 inclusive, a
				<replaceable>d</replaceable>-bit basic integer is encoded.</para>

			<para>If the integer, <replaceable>i</replaceable>, is greater than or equal to
				2<superscript><replaceable>d</replaceable></superscript>, a
				<replaceable>d</replaceable>-bit basic integer encoding of zero is inserted
				and then <replaceable>i</replaceable> -
				2<superscript><replaceable>d</replaceable></superscript> + 1 is encoded as a
				<replaceable>d</replaceable>-bit extendable encodin, and so on, recursively.</para>

		<title>The TDF encoding</title>

		<para>The descriptions of SORTS and constructors contain encoding information
			which is interpreted as follows to define the TDF encoding.</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>A TDF CAPSULE is an encoding of the <code>SORT CAPSULE</code>.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>For each <code>SORT</code> a number of encoding bits,
					<replaceable>b,</replaceable> is specified. If this is zero, there will only
					be one construction for the class, and its encoding will consist of
					the encodings of its components, in the given order.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>If the number of encoding bits, <replaceable>b</replaceable>, is not zero
					the <code>SORT</code> is described as extendable or as not extendable.
					For each construction there is an encoding number given. If the
					<code>SORT </code> is extendable, this number is output as an
					extendable integer. If the <code>SORT</code> is described as not
					extendable, the number is output as a basic integer. This is followed
					by the encodings of the components of the construction in the order
					given in the description of the construct.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>For the classes which are named
					<code>SLIST</code>(<replaceable>x</replaceable>)
					- e.g. <code>SLIST</code>(<code>UNIT</code>) - the encoding consists
					of a <code>TDFINT</code>, <replaceable>n</replaceable>, followed by
					<replaceable>n</replaceable> encodings of <replaceable>x</replaceable>.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>For the classes which are named
					<code>LIST</code>(<replaceable>x</replaceable>)
					- e.g. <code>LIST</code>(<code>EXP</code>) - the encoding consists of
					a 1-bit integer which will be 0, followed by an
					<code>SLIST</code>(<replaceable>x</replaceable>).	The 1-bit integer is to
					allow for extensions to other representations of <code>LIST</code>s.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>For the classes which are named <code>OPTION</code>(
					<replaceable>x</replaceable>) the encoding consists of a 1-bit basic
					integer. If this is zero, the option is absent and there is no more
					encoding. If the integer is 1, the option is present and an encoding
					of <replaceable>x</replaceable> follows.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para><code>BITSTREAMS</code> occur in only two kinds of place. One is the
					constructions with the form <replaceable>x_cond</replaceable>, which are the
					install-time conditionals. For each of these the class encoded in the
					<code>BITSTREAM</code> is the same as the class which is the result of
					the <replaceable>x_cond</replaceable> construction. The other kind of place
					is as the <replaceable>token_args</replaceable> component of a construction
					with the form <replaceable>x_apply_token</replaceable>. This component
					always gives the parameters of the <code>TOKEN</code>. It can only be
					decoded if there is a token definition or a token declaration for the
					particular token being applied, i.e. for the
					<replaceable>token_value</replaceable> component of the construction. In
					this case the <code>SORTS</code> and hence the classes of the actual
					token arguments are given by the declaration or definition, and
					encodings of these classes are placed in sequence after the number of
					bits. If the declaration or definition are not available, the
					<code>BITSTREAM</code> can only be skipped.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para><code>BYTESTREAM</code> <replaceable>X</replaceable> occurs in only one
					place, the encoding of the <code>SORT UNIT</code>. The
					<code>SORT</code> <replaceable>X</replaceable> is determined by the
					<code>UNIT</code> identification which is given for each of the
					relevant <code>SORTS</code>.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The <replaceable>tld</replaceable> <code>UNIT</code> is encoded specially.
					It is always the first <code>UNIT</code> in a Capsule and is used to
					pass information to the TDF linker. The first entry in a
					<replaceable>tld</replaceable> <code>UNIT</code> is a <code>TDFINT</code>
					giving the format of the remainder of the <code>UNIT</code>.
					Currently, the linker supports formats 0 and 1, but others may be
					added to give greater functionality while retaining compatibility.</para>

				<para>With format 0, the remainder of <code>UNIT</code> is identical to a
					now obsolete <replaceable>tld2</replaceable> <code>UNIT</code>.
					With format 1, the remainder of the <code>UNIT</code> is as follows: If
					<replaceable>n</replaceable> is the number of <code>EXTERN_LINK </code>s in
					the <replaceable>external_linkage</replaceable> argument of
					<replaceable>make_capsule</replaceable>, the remainder consists of
					<replaceable>n</replaceable> sequences. These sequences are in the order

	<title>The Overall Design of &tcc;</title>

	<section>
		<title>Specifying the &api;</title>

		<para>As we have seen, the &api; plays a far more concrete role
			in the &tdf; compilation strategy than in the traditional
			scheme.
			Therefore the &api; needs to be explicitly specified to
			&tcc; before any compilation takes place.
			As can be seen from Fig. 3, the &api; has three components.
			Firstly, in the target independent (or production) half of
			the compilation, there are the target independent headers
			which describe the API.
			Secondly in the target dependent (or installation) half,
			there is the &api; implementation for the particular target
			machine.
			This is divided between the &tdf; libraries, derived from
			the system headers, and the system libraries.
			Specifying the &api; to &tcc; essentially consists of
			telling it what target independent headers, &tdf; libraries
			and system libraries to use.
			The precise way in which this is done is discussed below
			(in section 4.3<!-- TODO: link -->).</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>The Main Compilation Path</title>

		<para>Once the &api; has been specified, the actual compilation
			can begin.
			The default action of &tcc; is to perform production and
			installation consecutively on the same machine; any other
			action needs to be explicitly specified.
			So let us describe the entire compilation path from C source
			to executable shown in Fig. 3.</para>

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>The first stage is production. The C &rarr; &tdf;
					producer transforms each input C source file into a
					target independent &tdf; capsule, using the target
					independent headers to describe the &api; in abstract
					terms.
					These target independent capsules will contain tokens to
					represent the uses of objects from the &api;, but these
					tokens will be left undefined.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The second stage, which is also the first stage of
					the installation, is &tdf; linking.
					Each target independent capsule is combined with the
					&tdf; library describing the &api; implementation to
					form a target dependent &tdf; capsule.
					Recall that the &tdf; libraries contain the local
					definitions of the tokens left undefined by the producer,
					so the resultant target dependent capsule will contain
					both the uses of these tokens and the corresponding
					token definitions.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The third stage of the compilation is for the
					&tdf; translator to transform each target dependent
					&tdf; capsule into an assembly source file for the
					appropriate target machine.
					Some &tdf; translators output not an assembly source
					file, but a binary object file.
					In this case the following assembler stage is
					redundant and the compilation skips to the system
					linking.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The next stage of the compilation is for each
					assembly source file to be translated into a binary
					object file by the system assembler.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The final compilation phase is for the system
					linker to combine all the binary object files with the
					system libraries to form a single, final executable.
					Recall that the system libraries are the final
					constituent of the &api; implementation, so this stage
					completes the combination of the program with the &api;
					implementation started in stage 2).</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

		<para>Let us, for convenience, tabulate these stages, giving the
			name of each compilation tool (plus the corresponding
			executable name), a code letter which &tcc; uses to refer to
			this stage, and the input and output file types for the
			stage (also see 7.2<!-- TODO: link -->).</para>

		<!-- TODO: this table is unsatisfying. -->

		</table>

		<para>The executable name of the &tdf; translator varies,
			depending on the target machine.
			It will normally start, or end, however, in &trans;.
			These stages are documented in more detail in
			sections 5.1<!-- TODO: link --> to 5.5.</para>

		<para>The code letters for the various compilation stages can
			be used in the <option>-W<replaceable>tool</replaceable>,
			<replaceable>opt</replaceable>, ...</option> command-line
			option to &tcc;. This passes the option(s)
			<replaceable>opt</replaceable> directly to the executable
			in the compilation stage identified by the letter
			<replaceable>tool</replaceable>.
			For example, <option>-Wl,&nbsp;-x</option> will cause the
			system linker to be invoked with the <option>-x</option>
			option.
			Similarly the
			<option>-E<replaceable>tool</replaceable>:&nbsp;<replaceable>file</replaceable></option>
			allows the executable to be invoked at the compilation
			stage <option>tool</option> to be specified as
			<replaceable>file</replaceable>.
			This allows the &tcc; user access to the compilation tools
			in a very direct manner.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Input File Types</title>

		<para>This compilation path may be joined at any point, and
			terminated at any point.
			The latter possibility is discussed below.
			For the former, &tcc; determines, for each input file it
			is given, to which of the file types it knows (C source,
			target independent &tdf;, etc.) this file belongs.
			This determines where in the compilation path described
			this file will start.
			The method used to determine the type of a file is the
			normal filename suffix convention:</para>

		<table>
			<col align="left"/>
			<col align="left"/>

			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Type</th>
					<th>Content</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><filename>*.c</filename></td>
					<td>C source</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><filename>*.j</filename></td>
					<td>Target independent &tdf; capsules</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><filename>*.t</filename></td>
					<td>Target dependent &tdf; capsules</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><filename>*.s</filename></td>
					<td>Assembly source files</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><filename>*.o</filename></td>
					<td>Binary object files</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><filename>*</filename></td>
					<td>Binary object files</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<para>Files whose type cannot otherwise be determined are assumed to
			be binary object files (for a complete list see 7.1<!-- TODO: link -->).</para>

		<para>Thus, for example, we speak of
			<quote><filename>.j</filename> files</quote> as a shorthand
			for <quote>target independent &tdf; capsules</quote>.
			Each file type recognised by &tcc; is assigned an
			identifying letter. For convenience, this corresponds to the
			suffix identifying the file type (<code>c</code> for C
			source files, <code>j</code> for target independent &tdf;
			capsules etc.).</para>

		<para>There is an alternative method of specifying input files,
			by means of the
			<option>-S<replaceable>type</replaceable>,&nbsp;<replaceable>file</replaceable>,&nbsp;...</option>
			command-line option.
			This specifies that the file <replaceable>file</replaceable>
			should be treated as an input file of the type corresponding
			to the letter <replaceable>type</replaceable>, regardless of
			its actual suffix.
			Thus, for example, <option>-Sc,&nbsp;<replaceable>file</replaceable></option>
			specifies that <replaceable>file</replaceable> should be
			regarded as a C source (or <filename>.c</filename>)
			file.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Intermediate and Output Files</title>

		<para>During the compilation, &tcc; makes up names for the
			output files of each of the compilation phases.
			These names are based on the input file name, but with the
			input file suffix replaced by the output file suffix (unless
			the <option>-make_up_names</option> command-line option is
			given, in which case the intermediate files are given names
			of the form <filename>_tccnnnn.x</filename>, where
			<filename>nnnn</filename> is a number which is incremented
			for each intermediate file produced, and
			<filename>x</filename> is the suffix corresponding to the
			output file type).
			Thus if the input file <filename>file.c</filename> is
			given, this will be transformed into
			<filename>file.j</filename> by the producer, which in turn
			will be transformed into <filename>file.t</filename> by the
			&tdf; linker, and so on.
			The system linker output file name can not be deduced in
			the same way since it is the result of linking a number of
			<filename>.o</filename> files.
			By default, as with &cc;, this file is called
			<filename>a.out</filename>.</para>

		<para>For most purposes these intermediate files are not
			required to be preserved; if we are compiling a single C
			source file to an executable, then the only output file we
			are interested in is the executable, not the intermediate
			files created during the compilation process.
			For this reason &tcc; creates a temporary directory in
			which to put these intermediate files, and removes this
			directory when the compilation is complete.
			All intermediate files are put into this temporary
			directory except:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>those which are an end product of the compilation
					(such as the executable),</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>those which are explicitly ordered to be preserved
					by means of command-line options,</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>binary object files, when more than one such file
					is produced (this is for compatibility with &cc;).</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>&tcc; can be made to preserve intermediate files of
			various types by means of the
			<option>-P<replaceable>type</replaceable>...</option>
			command-line option, which specifies a list of letters
			corresponding to the file types to be preserved.
			Thus for example <option>-Pjt</option> specifies that all
			&tdf; capsules produced, whether target independent or
			target dependent, (i.e. all <filename>.j</filename> and
			<filename>.t</filename> files) should be preserved.
			The special form <option>-Pa</option> specifies that all
			intermediate files should be preserved.
			It is also possible to specify that a certain file type
			should not be preserved by preceding the corresponding
			letter by <option>-</option> in the <option>-P</option>
			option.
			The only really useful application of this is to use
			<option>-P-o</option> to cancel the &cc; convention
			on preserving binary object files mentioned above.</para>

		<para>By default, all preserved files are stored in the
			current working directory.
			However the
			<option>-work&nbsp;<replaceable>dir</replaceable></option>
			command-line option specifies that they should be stored
			in the directory <replaceable>dir</replaceable>.</para>

		<para>The compilation can also be halted at any stage.
			The <option>-F<replaceable>type</replaceable></option>
			option to &tcc; tells it to stop the compilation after
			creating the files of the type corresponding to the letter
			<replaceable>type</replaceable>.
			Because any files of this type which are produced will be
			an end product of the compilation, they will automatically
			be preserved.
			For example, <option>-Fo</option> halts the compilation
			after the creation of the binary object, or
			<filename>.o</filename>, files (i.e. just before the system
			linking), and preserves all such files produced.
			A number of other &tcc; options are equivalent to options of
			the form <option>-F</option><replaceable>type</replaceable>:</para>

		<informaltable>
			<tr><td><option>-i</option> is equivalent to
				<option>-Fj</option> (i.e. just apply the producer),</td></tr>
			<tr><td><option>-S</option> is equivalent to
				<option>-Fs</option> (&cc; compatibility),</td></tr>
			<tr><td><option>-c</option> is equivalent to
				<option>-Fo</option> (&cc; compatibility).</td></tr>
		</informaltable>

		<para>If more than one <option>-F</option> option (including
			the equivalent options just listed) is given, then &tcc;
			issues a warning.
			The stage coming first in the compilation path takes
			priority.</para>

		<para>If the compilation has precisely one end product output
			file, then the name of this file can be specified to be
			<replaceable>file</replaceable> by means of the
			<option>-o</option> <replaceable>file</replaceable>
			command-line option.
			If a <option>-o</option> <replaceable>file</replaceable>
			option is given when there is more than one end product,
			then the first such file produced will be called
			<replaceable>file</replaceable>, and all such files
			produced subsequently will cause &tcc; to issue
			a warning.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Other Compilation Paths</title>

		<para>So far we have been discussing the main &tcc;
			compilation path from C source to executable.
			This is however only part of the picture.
			The full complexity (almost) of all the possible
			compilation paths supported by &tcc; is shown in
			Fig. 4<!-- TODO: link -->.
			This differs from Fig. 3<!-- TODO: link --> in that
			it only shows the left hand, or program, half of the
			main compilation diagram.
			The solid arrows show the default compilation paths;
			the dashed arrows are only followed if &tcc; is so
			instructed by means of command-line options.
			Let us consider those paths in this diagram which have
			not so far been mentioned.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Preprocessing</title>

			<para>The first paths to be considered involve preprocessed
				C source files.
				These form a distinct file type which &tcc; recognises
				by means of the <filename>.i</filename> file suffix.
				Input <filename>.i</filename> files are treated in
				exactly the same way as <filename>.c</filename> files;
				that is, they are fed into the producer.</para>

			<para>&tcc; can be made to preprocess the C source files it
				is given by means of the <option>-P</option> and
				<option>-E</option> options.
				If the <option>-P</option> option is given then each
				<filename>.c</filename> file is transformed into a
				corresponding <filename>.i</filename> file by the &tdf;
				C preprocessor, <application>tdfcpp</application>.
				If the <option>-E</option> option is given then the
				output of <filename>tdfcpp</filename> is sent instead
				to the standard output.
				In both cases the compilation halts after the
				preprocessor has been applied.
				Preprocessing is discussed further in section
				5.6.<!-- TODO: link --></para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>&tdf; Archives</title>

			<para>The second new file type introduced in
				Fig. 4<!-- TODO: link --> is the &tdf; archive.
				This is recognised by &tcc; by means of the
				<filename>.ta</filename> file suffix.
				Basically a &tdf; archive is a set of target
				independent &tdf; capsules (this is slightly
				simplified, see section 5.2.3<!-- TODO: link --> for more details).
				Any input &tdf; archives are automatically split into
				their constituent target independent capsules.
				These then join the main compilation path in the normal
				way.</para>

			<para>In order to create a &tdf; archive, &tcc; must be
				given the <option>-prod</option> command-line option.
				It will combine all the target independent &tdf;
				capsules it has into an archive, and the compilation
				will then halt.
				By default this archive is called
				<filename>a.ta</filename>, but another name may be
				specified using the <option>-o</option> option.</para>

			<para>The routines for splitting and building &tdf;
				archives are built into &tcc;, and are not implemented
				by a separate compilation tool (in particular, &tdf;
				archives are not <application>ar</application>
				archives).
				Really &tdf; archives are a &tcc;-specific construction;
				they are not part of &tdf; proper.</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>&tdf; Notation</title>

			<para>&tdf; has the form of an abstract syntax tree which
				is encoded as a series of bits.
				In order to examine the contents of a &tdf; capsule it
				is necessary to translate it into an equivalent human
				readable form.
				Two tools are provided which do this.
				The &tdf; pretty printer, &disp;, translates &tdf; into
				text, whereas the &tdf; notation compiler, &tnc;, both
				translates &tdf; to text and text to &tdf;.
				The two textual forms of &tdf; are incompatible -
				&disp; output cannot be used as &tnc; input. &disp; is
				in many ways the more sophisticated decoder - it
				understands the &tdf; extensions used to handle
				diagnostics, for example - but it does not handle the
				text to &tdf; translation which &tnc; does.
				By default &tnc; is a text to &tdf; translator, it needs
				to be passed the <option>-p</option> flag in order to
				translate &tdf; into text.
				We refer to the textual form of &tdf; supported by &tnc;
				as &tdf; notation.</para>

			<para>By default, &tcc; uses &disp;.
				If it is given the <option>-disp</option> command-line option
				then all target independent &tdf; capsules
				(<filename>.j</filename> files) are transformed into
				text using <application>disp</application>.
				The <option>-disp_t</option> option causes all target
				dependent &tdf; capsules (<filename>.t</filename> files)
				to be transformed into text.
				In both cases the output files have a
				<filename>.p</filename> suffix, and the compilation
				halts after they are produced.</para>

			<para>In order for &tnc; to be used, the
				<option>-Ytnc</option> flag should be passed to &tcc;.
				In this case the <option>-disp</option> and the
				<option>-disp_t</option> option cause, not &disp;, but
				<option>tnc&nbsp;-p</option>, to be invoked.
				But this flag also causes &tcc; to recognise files with
				a <filename>.p</filename> suffix as &tdf; notation source
				files.
				These are translated by &tnc; into target independent
				&tdf; capsules, which join the main compilation path in
				the normal way.</para>

			<para>Similarly if the <option>-Ypl_tdf</option> flag is
				passed to &tcc; then it recognises files with a
				<filename>.tpl</filename> suffix as PL_TDF source files.
				These are translated by the PL_TDF compiler, &tpl;,
				into target independent &tdf; capsules.</para>

			<para>&disp; and &tnc; are further discussed in section
				5.7<!-- TODO: link -->.</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Merging &tdf; Capsules</title>

			<para>The final unexplored path in Fig. 4 is the ability to
				combine all the target independent &tdf; capsules into
				a single capsule.
				This is specified by means of the <option>-M</option>
				command-line option to &tcc;.
				The combination of these capsules is performed by the
				&tdf; linker, &tld;.
				Whereas in the main compilation path &tld; is used to
				combine a single target independent &tdf; capsule with
				the &tdf; libraries to form a target dependent &tdf;
				capsule, in this case it is used to combine several
				target independent capsules into a single target
				independent capsule.
				By default the combined capsule is called
				<filename>a.j</filename>.
				The compilation will continue after the combination
				phase, with the resultant capsule rejoining the main
				compilation path.
				This merging operation is further discussed in section
				5.2.2<!-- TODO: link -->.</para>

			<para>The only unresolved issue in this case is, if the
				<option>-M</option> option is given, to what
				<filename>.j</filename> files do the
				<option>-Fj</option> and the <option>-Pj</option>
				options refer?
				In fact, &tcc; takes them to refer to the merged &tdf;
				capsule rather than the capsules which are merged to
				form it.
				The <option>-Pa</option> option, however, will cause
				both sets of capsules to be preserved.</para>
		</section>

		<para>To summarise, &tcc; has an extra three file types, and
			an extra three compilation tools (not including the
			&tdf; archive creating and splitting routines which are

		<title>Finding out what tcc is doing</title>

		<para>With so many different file types and alternative
			compilation paths, it is often useful to be able to
			keep track of what &tcc; is doing.
			There are several command-line options which do this.
			The simplest is <option>-v</option> which specifies that
			&tcc; should print each command in the compilation process
			on the standard output before it is executed.
			The <option>-vb</option> option is similar, but only causes the
			name of each input file to be printed as it is processed.
			Finally the <option>-dry</option> option specifies that the
			commands should be printed (as with <option>-v</option>) but not
			actually executed.
			This can be used to experiment with &tcc; to find out what it
			would do in various circumstances.</para>

		<para>Occasionally an unclear error message may be printed by one
			of the compilation tools.
			In this case the <option>-show_errors</option> option to
			&tcc; might be useful. It causes &tcc; to print the command
			it was executing when the error occurred.
			By default, if an error occurs during the construction of
			an output file, the file is removed by &tcc;.
			It can however be preserved for examination using the
			<option>-keep_errors</option> option.
			This applies not only to normal errors, but also to
			exceptional errors such as the user interrupting &tcc; by
			pressing <userinput>^C</userinput>, or one of the compilation
			tools crashing.
			In the latter case, &tcc; will also remove any core file
			produced, unless the <option>-keep_errors</option> option is
			specified.</para>

		<para>For purposes of configuration control, the
			<option>-version</option> flag will cause &tcc; to print its
			version number.
			This will typically be of the form:</para>

		<screen>tcc: Version: 4.0, Revision: 1.5, Machine: hp</screen>

		<para>giving the version and revision number, plus the target
			machine identifier.
			The <option>-V</option> flag will also cause each compilation
			tool to print its version number (if appropriate) as it is
			invoked.</para>

<chapter>
	<title>&tcc; Environments</title>

	<para>In addition to command-line options, there is a
		second method of specifying &tcc;'s behaviour, namely
		&tcc; environments.</para>

	<para>An environment is just a file consisting of lines of the form:</para>

	<programlisting language="env"><replaceable>*</replaceable><replaceable>IDENTIFIER</replaceable> &quot;<replaceable>text</replaceable>&quot;</programlisting>

	<para>where <replaceable>*</replaceable> stands for one of the
		environment prefixes, <code>+</code>, <code>&lt;</code> and
		<code>&gt;</code> (in fact <code>?</code> is also a valid
		environment prefix.
		It is used to query the values represented by environmental identifiers.
		If &tcc; is invoked with the <option>-Ystatus</option> command-line option it
		will print the values of all the environmental identifiers it recognises).
		Any line in the environment not beginning with one of these characters
		is ignored.
		<replaceable>IDENTIFIER</replaceable> will be one of the environmental
		identifiers recognised by &tcc;, the environment prefix
		will tell &tcc; how to modify the value given by this identifier,
		and <replaceable>text</replaceable> what to modify it by.</para>

	<para>The simplest environmental identifiers are those which are
		used to pass flags to &tcc; and the various components of the
		compilation system. The line:</para>

	<programlisting language="env">+FLAG &quot;text&quot;</programlisting>

	<para>causes <code>text</code> to be interpreted by &tcc; as
		if it was a command-line option. Similarly:</para>

	<programlisting language="env">+FLAG_TDFC &quot;text&quot;</programlisting>

	<para>causes <code>text</code> to be passed as an option to &tdfc;.
		There are similar environmental identifiers for each of the
		components of the compilation system (see 7.6<!-- TODO: link -->
		for a complete list).</para>

	<para>The second class of environmental identifiers are those
		corresponding to simple string variables. Only the form:</para>

	<programlisting language="env">+IDENTIFIER &quot;text&quot;</programlisting>

	<para>is allowed. This will set the corresponding variable to
		<code>text</code>.
		The permitted environmental identifiers and the
		corresponding variables are:</para>

	<table>
		<col align="left"/>
		<col align="left"/>

		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Variable</th>
				<th>Content</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><code>ENVDIR</code></td>
				<td>The default environments directory (see section
					<!-- TODO: link --> 4.1)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>PORTABILITY</code></td>
				<td>The producer portability table
					(see section 5.1.3)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>TEMP</code></td>
				<td>The default temporary directory
					(see section 6.4)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>VERSION</code></td>
				<td>The target machine version
					(Mips only, see section 5.3.4)</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<para>The final class of environmental identifiers are
		those corresponding to lists of strings. Firstly <code>text</code>
		is transformed into a list of strings, b say, by splitting at
		any spaces, then the list corresponding to the identifier,
		a say, is modified by this value.
		How this modification is done depends on the environment prefix:</para>

	<table>
		<col align="center"/>
		<col align="left"/>

		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Prefix</th>
				<th>Behaviour</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><code>+</code></td>
				<td><code>a = b</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>&gt;</code></td>
				<td><code>a = a + b</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>&lt;</code></td>
				<td><code>a = b + a</code></td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<para>where <code>+</code> denotes concatenation of lists.
		The lists represented in this way include those giving the
		pathnames of the executables of the various compilation
		components (plus default flags).
		These are given by the identifiers &tdfc;, &tld;, etc.
		(see 7.6 <!-- TODO: link --> for a complete list).
		The other lists can be divided between those affecting
		the producer, the &tdf; linker, and the system linker
		respectively (see sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.5 <!-- TODO: link -->
		for more details):</para>

		<title>The Environment Search Path</title>

		<para>The command-line option
			<option>-Y<replaceable>env</replaceable></option> tells &tcc;
			to read the environment <replaceable>env</replaceable>.
			If <replaceable>env</replaceable> is not a full pathname
			then it is searched for along the environment search path.
			This consists of a colon-separated list of directories,
			the initial segment of which
			is given by the system variable <code>TCCENV</code>
			(we use the term <quote>system variable</quote> to describe
			<code>TCCENV</code> rather than the more normal
			<quote>environmental variable</quote> to avoid confusion with
			&tcc; environments) if this is defined,
			and the final segment of which consists of the default
			environments directory, which is built into &tcc;
			at compile-time, and the current working directory.
			The option <option>-vd</option>
			causes &tcc; to print this environment search path.
			If the environment cannot be found, then a warning is
			issued.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>The Default Environment: Configuring tcc</title>

		<para>The most important environment is the
			<code>default</code> environment, which is built into
			&tcc; at compile-time.
			This does not mean that the <code>default</code>
			environment is read every time that &tcc; is invoked,
			but rather that it is read once (at compile-time) to
			determine the default configuration of &tcc;.</para>
			<!-- TODO: is it? -->

		<para>The information included in the <code>default</code>
			environment includes: the pathnames and default flags of the
			various components of the compilation system; the target
			machine type; the default temporary directory; the
			specification of the target independent headers, &tdf;
			libraries and system libraries comprising the default
			&api; (which is always &ansi;); the variables specifying
			the default compilation mode; the default environments
			directory (mentioned above).</para>

		<para>&tcc; is designed to work on many different target machines.
			All the information on where the executables, include files,
			&tdf; libraries etc. are located on a particular machine
			is stored in the standard environments, and in particular,
			the <code>default</code> environment.
			The interaction with the system assembler and, more
			importantly, the system linker is also expressed using
			environments.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Using Environments to Specify &api;s</title>

		<para>Another important use of environments concerns their use
			in specifying &api;s.
			As was mentioned above, an &api; may be considered to have
			three components: the target independent headers, giving an
			abstract description of the &api; to the producer, and the
			&tdf; libraries and system libraries, giving the details of
			the &api; implementation to the installer.
			Environments are an ideal medium for expressing this information.
			The <code>INCL</code>
			environmental identifier can be used to specify the location
			of the target independent headers, <code>LIB</code> and
			<code>LINK</code> the location of the &tdf; libraries,
			and <code>SYS_LIB</code> and <code>SYS_LINK</code> the
			location of the system libraries.  Moreover, all this
			information can be canned into a single command-line
			option.</para>

		<para>A number of standard &api;s have been described as target
			independent headers and are provided with the &tdf; system.
			A &tcc; environment is provided for each of these &api;s
			(for example, <code>ansi</code>, <code>posix</code>,
			<code>xpg3</code> - see 7.5<!-- TODO: link --> for a complete
			list, also see section 6.3<!-- TODO: link -->).
			There is an important distinction
			to be made between base &api;s (for example, POSIX) and
			extension &api;s (for example, X11 Release 5).
			The command-line option <option>-Yposix</option> sets the
			&api; to be precisely POSIX, whereas the option
			<option>-Yx5_lib</option> sets it to the existing &api; plus
			the X11 Release 5 basic X library.
			This is done by using <code>+INCL</code> etc. in the
			<code>posix</code> environment to set the various variables
			corresponding to these environmental identifiers to
			precisely the values for POSIX, but <code>&lt;INCL</code> etc.
			in the <code>x5_lib</code> environment to extend these
			variables by the values for X11 Release 5.
			Thus, to specify the &api; POSIX plus X11 Release 5, the
			command-line options <option>-Yposix&nbsp;-Yx5_lib</option>
			are required (in that order).</para>

		<para>All the standard &api; environments provided also contain
			lines which set, or modify, the <code>INFO</code> environmental
			identifier.
			This contains textual information on the API, including &api;
			names and version numbers.
			This information can be printed by invoking &tcc;
			with the <option>-info</option> command-line option.
			For example, the command-line options:</para>

		<screen>% tcc -info -Yposix -Yx5_lib</screen>

		<para>cause the message:</para>

		<screen>tcc: API is X11 Release 5 Xlib plus POSIX (1003.1).</screen>

		<para>to be printed.</para>

		<para>As was mentioned above, the default &api; is <code>C89</code>.
			Thus invoking &tcc; without specifying an &api; environment
			is equivalent to giving the <option>-Yc89</option>
			command-line option.
			On the basis that, when it comes to portability, explicit
			decisions are better than implicit ones, the use of
			<option>-Yc89</option> is recommended.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Using Environments to Implement tcc Options</title>

		<para>Another use to which environments are put is to
			implement certain &tcc; command-line options.
			In particular, some options require different actions
			depending on the target machine.
			It is far easier to implement these by means of an
			environment, which can be defined differently on each
			target machine, rather than by trying to build all the
			alternative definitions into &tcc;.</para>

		<para>An important example is the <option>-g</option> flag,
			which causes the generation of information for symbolic
			debugging.
			Depending on the target machine, different flags may need
			to be passed to the assembler and system linker when
			<option>-g</option> is specified, or the default
			<filename>.o</filename> files and libraries used by the
			linker may need to be changed.
			For this reason &tcc; uses a standard environment,
			<code>tcc_diag</code>, to implement the
			<option>-g</option> option.</para>

		<para>For a complete list of those options which are
			implemented by means of environments, see 7.7<!-- TODO: link -->.
			If the given option is not supported on a particular
			target machine, then the corresponding environment will not
			exist, and &tcc; will issue a warning to that effect.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>User-Defined Environments</title>

		<para>The &tcc; user can also set up and use environments.
			It is anticipated that this facility will be used mainly to
			group a number of &tcc; command-line options into an
			environment using the <code>FLAG</code> environmental
			identifier and to set up environments corresponding to
			user-defined &api;s.</para>

		<title><!-- TODO Why --></title>

		<section>
			<title><!-- TODO daunting --></title>
			<para>
				Adding new APIs can be rather daunting for several reasons:
			</para>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO They can be huge -->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO they're confusing -->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO even when they're not confusing, they're complex:
				there're fun exceptions like "the value of the limit
				may differ from those given in this header ..."
				which require special cases -->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO Figuring out which bits inherit from existing APIs is
				confusing (explain inheritance) -->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO It's unlikely that tspec is familiar -->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO not adding them is easier (see Temptations
				for the easy way) -->
			</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title><!-- TODO Why bother at all? --></title>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO good question. specs aren't required -->
			</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title><!-- TODO Why be so pedantic about inheritance? --></title>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				Why bother with inheritance?  - also good...
				you can write the same thing without inheritance.
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				recap what inheritance is first
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				One argument is to centralise code, and 
				mistakes (either in your API or the existing ones)
				This helps test the existing ones.
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				Motivational speech: it's very easy to make something
				here that works; it's very tedious to make it correct
				and since it's a specification, it *has* to be correct,
				or there's no point
				-->
			</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title><!-- TODO Temptations for the easy way --></title>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				For example, temptation and POSIX3:
				- explain temptation
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				I'm going through them one by one 
				and checking... instead of (incorrectly) editing the POSIX1 
				definition, those should be under POSIX3 (which is incomplete) 
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				I'm trying to really check everything that goes on here,
				so we don't accidentally break unrelated things
				(unrelated things being machine definitions, or other specs)
				-->
			</para>
		</section>

		<!-- TODO -->
		<para>
			<!-- TODO
			In conclusion:
			Explain that this is tedious, pedantic, difficult to get
			right, and also very important that it *is* done correctly.
			That's pretty much the worst case for a task on all parts.

		<title><!-- TODO Looking at your API --></title>

		<para>
			<!-- TODO
			Discuss about your API:
			What API are you adding?
			-->
		</para>

		<section>
			<title><!-- TODO is it a viable candidate at all? --></title>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				What APIs are suitable for inclusion into the base, and what
				aren't (i.e. if it's important enough to come with your OS's
				base, and has a stable standard, we should probably include
				it - if it's a moving target or work in progress, we probably
				shouldn't). This should also mention something about which
				language are supported.
				-->
			</para>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<section>
				<title><!-- TODO is it standardised and no longer in flux --></title>

				<!-- TODO -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<title><!-- TODO is it useful to people other than yourself? --></title>

				<!-- TODO -->

				<!--
					TODO: it would be interesting to let users specify their
					own APIs privately (or perhaps make a community resource
					of APIs for projects somehow. Perhaps this should be a ticket
				-->
			</section>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title><!-- TODO How it relates to other APIs --></title>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				When to inherit, and when to write from scratch (i.e. write
				from scratch if the specification independently states the
				same thing as another by coincidence, as opposed to
				explicitly stating that it should correlate with (and defer
				to!) a parent specification)
				-->
			</para>

			<section>
				<title>Inheriting APIs</title>

				<para>
					This is the usual case: an API that builds on previous
					standards. For example, POSIX builds on ANSI.
				</para>

				<!-- TODO explain more -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<title>Standalone APIs</title>

				<!-- TODO -->
				<para>
					<!-- TODO
					If it's an entirely self-standing API,
					*sure* it's appropriate to add? (it might be)

		<title>Implementation Approach</title>

		<!-- TODO -->

			Implementation details. Link to the tspec guides
			sections here.

		<section>
			<title>Sequence of Implementation</title>

			<!-- TODO -->
			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				How not to be overwhelmed by the sheer size of something
				like POSIX3. Some dicipline is required here: do not get eager.
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				APIs can be large; you can optimise work flow by grouping
				related tasks. Less switching between modes gives faster
				implementation time and less mistakes
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				One thing that's helping me here is to tackle strictly only
				the really simple files first, leaving the complex ones for
				later. The rough pattern there is to finish working on lots
				of simple ones all at once, and then to spend a longer time
				working through each complex file individually. This also
				helps keep up motivation by cutting down the list of incoming
				things!
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				i was doing all the headers which only define constants, first
				then all the ones which inherit things from previous 
				specifications (this is very tedious to get right)
				limits.h was way down that list
				-->
			</para>

			<para>
				<!-- TODO
				but we can do just the things needed, first, if you like
				think about customer demand: we can provide it without
				damaging our project. maybe even partial headers
				(comment them)
				-->

				How our inheritance is structured at the directory level

				incorrectly. But we have a method to express this properly:

		<title><!-- TODO Interesting Points from a Worked Example --></title>

		<para>
			<!-- TODO
			e.g. POSIX3. introduce the background to why we added this.
			(getting hold of the POSIX2 spec was annoying;
			if you want to do this; you need it to see where 
			to inherit and where not to and to double-check)
			-->

		<para>
			<!-- TODO
			see POSIX2/limits.h - that just imports from POSIX1, 
			but limits.h changes significantly for v3

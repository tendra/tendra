# tspec: API Specification tool

tspec is a specification tool used in the TenDRA API descriptions.
See <http://www.tendra.org/> for details.

## Structure

The source divided into a number of subdirectories:

  base         containing the TenDRA API descriptions used in
               its API checking facilities;

  extension    containing APIs which provide extensions to APIs
               from the base directory.

## Historical Changes

 - .tspec files historically had no extension

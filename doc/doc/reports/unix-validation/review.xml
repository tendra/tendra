		<title>Installation of the UnixWare binary delivery</title>

		<para>When installing the UnixWare system from the binary delivery, we
			faced one problem when installing optional packages such as nfs. This
			was due to corrupted entries in a file containing information about
			every file which is installed on the system through the packaging
			system, /var/sadm/intall/contents. Deleting the corrupted entries,
			removing the badly installed package and reinstalling it cured the
			problem.</para>

		<title>NAT-NAT build phase</title>

		<para> Very few problems were encountered during this phase. We had some
			troubles when building X11 &amp; Motif, first because we had forgotten
			to customize a definition in a Makefile stating that we were using
			binaries for Motif and not building it from sources; secondly because
			two Makefiles were buggy.  This had no impact on other project phases
			since the graphic system was not covered by DRA-NAT and DRA-DRA
			experiments.</para>

	<section>
		<title>DRA-NAT build phase</title>

		<para>This phase was the longest and richest. We describe below the
			problems we had successively.</para>

		<para><emphasis>Use of the TenDRA compiler throughout the build
			process</emphasis></para>

		<para>In the first steps of the build procedure, just modifying the PATH
			environment variable was enough to use the TenDRA compiler as a pseudo
			cc compiler. These steps include the building of libraries and
			cross-environment tools, among which a new C compiler which was used
			as soon as it was built. From this stage, we had to modify the build
			procedure in order to substitute the freshly built compiler by a shell
			script which emulates a call to the new compiler by a call to the
			TenDRA tcc compiler.</para>

		<para>In order to mimic the behavior of the compiler we want to replace,
			we had to pass an option to tcc to modify the search path for the
			system libraries.  With this option tcc calls the UnixWare linker with
			information on the location of the libraries. Assuming that the
			TOOLS_REF variable contains the correct path for the current build
			tools, the option line we used was:</para>

		<para>-Wl:-YP,$TOOLS_REF/usr/ccs/lib:$TOOLS_REF/usr/lib</para>

		<para><emphasis>C-programming issues</emphasis></para>

		<para>Most issues related to poor ANSI conformance have been by-passed
			by using the tcc options -Xa -not_ansi -nepc.</para>

		<para>However, in a few cases, we had to make minor changes in source
			files:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>to avoid type promotion conflicts when a function was declared
					with the prototype notation, and defined using the K&amp;R syntax.
					We changed the definition to use the prototype notation
					also.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>to fix a mismatch in the number of arguments of a function,
					e.g. when such function was declared without argument and defined
					empty, but called with one argument.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>to force the setting of __USLC__ preprocessor variable, which
					is set by default by UnixWare C compilers. We discovered this
					during the link-edit of a library, as some symbols were referenced
					but undefined.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para><emphasis>Mapping special features of UnixWare compiler to
			TenDRA</emphasis></para>

		<para>Such features appeared through command line options which were
			local to some Makefiles, or through #pragma directives in
			sources.</para>

		<para>Consider first a simple example: the normal option for producing
			position-independent code is -KPIC, for both UnixWare cc and TenDRA.
			However, a Makefile, responsible for building a shared library, was
			using -Kpic instead. This option was supported by UnixWare but ignored
			by TenDRA.  This resulted in a fatal error at library link-edit time.
			A quick way to make TenDRA understand the -Kpic option is to create
			inside the TenDRA svr4_i386/env directory a file named K-pic by
			linking it to the existing file K-PIC.</para>

		<para>The following two options of the UnixWare compiler can be ignored
			(e.g.  filtered out): -Kno_host and -W0,-1c. The first one disables
			the inlining of some C standard functions, and the second tells the
			compiler to treat literal strings as constants. These two options
			correspond to the default behavior for TenDRA.</para>

		<para>The UnixWare compiler supports a pragma directive, to disable some
			floating point optimization, termed fenv_access on. This directive was
			used in a module to raise a floating point exception at run-time
			rather than at compilation time. There is no equivalent option for
			TenDRA, and furthermore tcc would abort when such a source file was
			compiled. A fix was later supplied by DRA.</para>

		<para>The #pragma weak directive of the native compiler supports nested
			references to symbols such as:</para>

		<para>#pragma weak sym1 = sym2</para>

		<para>#pragma weak sym2 = sym3</para>

		<para>This rarely used feature was not correctly supported by TenDRA.
			This has been easily changed in the source code, and DRA will fix the
			problem.</para>

		<para>UnixWare provides developers with a utility termed fur to reorder
			the functions in a relocatable object. This utility was used in
			Makefiles when building the shared version of libraries, and used to
			fail, complaining of missing function names. These functions appeared
			to be declared as static in sources, and in such case the TenDRA
			default behavior is to discard the related symbols. TenDRA supports a
			pragma directive to change this default behavior. For example #pragma
			preserve * will keep all symbols. As all library modules compiled with
			-KPIC option were concerned, we have modified the svr4_i386/K-PIC file
			already mentioned in this document, adding the line:</para>

		<para>&gt;STARTUP -f/andf/svr4_i386/env/static_pic.h</para>

		<para>This static_pic file was then created, containing:</para>

		<para>#pragma preserve *</para>

		<para>Finally, we mention a difference between the native compiler and
			the TenDRA one which had no incidence but a warning message at
			link-edit time. tcc generates an alignment of 8 for global structures
			whose size is greater than 63, while the native compiler always use an
			alignment of 4; when linking an object file compiled by the native
			compiler and an object file compiled by TenDRA which both declare the
			same structure, the linker issued a warning.</para>

	<section id="dra-nat-validation">
		<title>DRA-NAT validation, manually exercising commands and
			libraries</title>

		<para> The first level of validation we performed on the commands built
			in DRA-NAT mode was to use these commands to replace the native ones.
			We simply did this by modifying the PATH environment variable. Two
			errors, inside the vi command, were detected, and then fixed, during
			these tests.</para>

		<para> We exercised in the same way the DRA-NAT version of the shared
			libc library.  This validation revealed problems with grep, sed, and
			the search subcommand of vi, cpio and find. When investigating the
			grep command, it appeared that using the DRA-NAT static version of the
			libc library solved the problem.  Thus we focused on the generation of
			position-independent code (-KPIC option) by the TenDRA compiler. We
			reported a bug to DRA, which was fixed in the subsequent release of
			the TenDRA software. Rebuilding the shared libc library with the new
			version of the TenDRA compiler fixed the problems for the grep, vi and
			find commands. The sed command still did not behave correctly and
			needs further investigation. The problem with cpio was due to a
			mistake in our procedure for switching from the native version of the
			shared libc library to the DRA-NAT version: we forgot to take into
			account the file /usr/lib/libdl.so.1 together with the file
			/usr/lib/libc.so.1, while these two files are linked. This point was
			discovered after looking at the Makefile of the cpio command (local
			libraries used here include libld).</para>

	<section>
		<title>DRA-NAT validation phase, booting the kernel</title>

		<para>Despite the fact that the kernel is a complex and sensitive part
			of the system, we found only two problems while exercising kernels
			with more and more DRA-NAT built components.</para>

		<para>The first problem we had was a PANIC message when running a kernel
			with some DRA-NAT code. Using the crash command on the dumpfile file
			created at system crash time, we located the problem in a call to a
			function coded in assembly language. The comments embedded in the
			source file told us that the code was making special assumptions on
			the arguments and return value, which appeared to be
			compiler-dependant. Instead of rewriting the code, we recompiled with
			the native compiler the few C modules which were calling this
			function.</para>

		<para>The second problem we had did more damage to the system disk (some
			configuration files became corrupted). We managed to repair these
			files using the Emergency Recovery floppies and making comparisons
			with our second platform (which had been carefully kept away from
			risky experiments). The problem was due to a small difference between
			code generated by the native compiler and the TenDRA compiler, which
			would have usually no incidence.  When a global variable is defined
			and initialized to zero, the native compiler puts it in a DATA section
			while the TenDRA compiler puts it (by default) in a COMMON section.
			During the build of the kernel, a utility was used to patch the value
			of such a variable inside an object file, and this operation failed
			(silently) when the object file had been created by TenDRA.  The
			TenDRA installer comes with an install-time option -h which makes it
			behave like the native compiler in respect to this point.</para>

	<section>
		<title>DRA-NAT validation phase, VSX4</title>

		<para>We used the VSX4 test suite to exercise the TenDRA technology in
			three successive steps.</para>

		<para>Firstly, we built the VSX4 tests with the TenDRA compiler and the
			static DRA-NAT system libraries. Then we ran the tests on a system
			with a native kernel.</para>

		<para>Secondly, we ran the tests built in the previous step on a system
			with a DRA-NAT kernel.</para>

		<para>Finally, we rebuilt the VSX4 tests, with the TenDRA compiler, on
			a system with shared DRA-NAT system libraries (when available) and a
			DRA-NAT kernel, and ran the suite on the same system.</para>

		<para>During these three steps, the PATH environment variable was
			giving access exclusively to DRA-NAT built commands. Only a few
			commands are actually exercised by the VSX4 test suite: ar, awk, grep,
			ld, lorder, make, sed, sh, tsort (...) at build time, cpio, gencat and
			tar at execution time.</para>

		<para>Five libraries are required, thus exercised, to build the VSX4
			tests for UnixWare: libc, libm, libmalloc, libgen and libcrypt. A
			dynamically-linked variant exists for libc and libcrypt only.</para>

		<para>Surprisingly enough, none of the problems we had were located in
			the DRA-NAT build being validated. All the VSX4 tests (approximately
			6,000) successful when using native system were also successful on the
			DRA-NAT system.  However, we faced three other types of
			problems:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Tests failing because of wrong permission on a work directory;
					this simply came from the way we created a new target tree for
					VSX4 test binaries.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>Unclean code in test source. For example, the volatile
					qualifier of a variable was missing, though the varaible was
					modified by a signal handler and tested inside a while loop. Since
					optimizations are enabled by default in TenDRA, this test failed
					when compiled by tcc. There were two other tests which failed
					because of undesirable optimizations made by the TenDRA
					optimizer.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The static and shared variant of the libc library does not
					behave the same in some cases. 14 tests failed when using the
					static version of the libc library (native or DRA-NAT), which
					passed when using the shared libc library.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>DRA-NAT validation phase, AIMIII</title>

		<para>Due to a yet unexplained problem occurring when exercising either
			native or DRA-NAT systems, AIMIII benchmark results have only been
			obtained up to a load of 63 users.</para>

		<para>When running the benchmark, we tried to use an environment as
			stable as possible. We installed the benchmark on a local file system,
			used only for this purpose, and disabled the cron daemon. However, we
			had noticeable differences (peak difference up to 15%) between the
			results of two equivalent runs at a small user load (1-10 users),
			while such differences drop to 1% at a load of 60 users.</para>

		<para>To avoid side effects when measuring performance, we have always
			used the native compiler to compile the benchmark. The latter has to
			be linked only with the libc library, and we have used the shared
			variant.  Exercising the DRA-NAT build requires booting the DRA-NAT
			kernel and setting up the DRA-NAT version of the dynamically-loaded
			libc.</para>

		<para>Given these assumptions, native and DRA-NAT systems have similar
			performance: within a load range of 20-60 users, differences are below
			3%.</para>

	<section>
		<title>DRA-DRA phase</title>

		<para>A first experiment on very simple commands (echo, touch), showed
			that the base API on which the commands were built was a mix of the
			svid3 and xpg4 APIs. In fact, 57 commands, out of more than 600, were
			based on this base API. When we tried to extend this API to cover more
			commands, it quickly became apparent that most of the commands need
			their own extension to the base API. Thus, each additional command
			requires a lot of work in order to compile in DRA-DRA mode. During the
			time of the experiment, we could only extend the API to cover about
			100 commands.</para>

		<para>We list below miscellaneous problems we encountered, which
			required some modification in source files:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Implicit function declarations</para>

				<para>We wanted to suppress all the warnings due to missing function
					prototypes for the commands we worked on. This was important in
					order to make sure that every function used by a command was in
					the interface we defined. However, in most of the commands we
					worked on, internal functions returning an int were not declared.
					So, we had to add their declaration in the source files in order
					to suppress warnings on these functions. When this was done,
					remaining warnings were due to use of functions without inclusion
					of the include files where they were defined, or to incomplete
					include files, in which case we added the prototype to the
					interface.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>Redeclaration of errno</para>

				<para>In a few source files, errno was defined as a token by the
					inclusion of the &lt;errno.h&gt; include file, but was also
					defined in the file with the instruction:</para>

				<programlisting language="c">extern int errno;</programlisting>

				<para>Since errno can be implemented in different ways on different
					architectures, it must not be declared as an int variable. This
					problem has been corrected by removing this declaration from the
					source file.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>Redefinition of API functions</para>

				<para>In a few cases, a function was declared in an include file as
					being part of the API, e.g rewind, but was later defined in the
					file. We corrected the problem by renaming the internal function
					so that the conflict does not exist any longer.</para>

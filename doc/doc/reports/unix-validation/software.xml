	<para>UnixWare is a desktop Operating System derived from System V release
		4.2.</para>

	<para>It includes support for TCP/IP and Netware networking, X/Window,
		Motif and a Desktop Manager.</para>

	<para><emphasis>UnixWare Version and Release Level</emphasis></para>

	<para>A beta release of UnixWare version 2.0 for the Intel386 family
		(Load q7.1) source code was used.</para>

	<para><emphasis>Authors</emphasis></para>

	<para>The authors of the UnixWare system are the Novell, Inc., with
		portions of code developed by other contributors such as the University
		of Berkeley and MIT.</para>

	<para><emphasis>Source code</emphasis></para>

	<para>The source code delivery for UnixWare 2.0 beta release represents
		approximately 240 Mbytes of code. Most of the system has been recompiled
		during the NAT-NAT phase of this project.</para>

	<para>Included in this code is a graphical interface, based on X11 and
		Motif. However, since this interface contains some code delivered in
		binary format and since this interface is an optional part of a Unix
		system, we did not use this code.</para>

	<para>In addition, various data files are delivered, for configuration and
		messaging, especially under Command &amp; tools directories. In
		addition, some parts of the system, for example the kernel code for the
		vxfs file system and some device drivers, appear to be delivered in
		binary format only. So, a more accurate view of the volume of source
		code submitted to the TenDRA technology is provided by sizing the C
		language source files only:</para>

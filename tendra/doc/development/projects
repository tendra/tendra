Projects
========

These projects are intended to showcase TenDRA's ideas, by providing
example platforms. One intention here is to try to break free from the
usual methods of implementing such things, in an effort to gain some
publicity from curious people.

For the moment, though, our focus is on TenDRA itself: I am keeping
this list simply so that I do not loose track of the ideas.

For features directly relating to TenDRA itself, see the features
document.


Eval
----

An implementation of eval() for C. This is essentially a "hello world"
for libTenDRA.

In its first incarnation, it can compile to a temporary file, dynamically
load it, and execute the contents. Eventually, it can be modified to
make use of the TDF interpreter.


Runtime TDF interpreter
-----------------------

Initially, this can start out as the simplest possible implementation.
I'd like to take as much advantage of TDF's features as possible, so
using something like LLVM as a base may not be appropriate: this remains
to be seen.

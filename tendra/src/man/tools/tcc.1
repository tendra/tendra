.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBtcc\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIfiles\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtcc\fP is the user interface to the TDF system\&. It is
more fully documented in the \fItcc User\&'s Guide (link to URL http://www.ten15.org/docs/tcc/) \fR\&.
.PP
\fBtcc\fP accepts several types of arguments as
\fIfiles\fP:

Arguments whose names end in \f(CW\&.c\fP are
understood to be C source files\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Arguments whose names end in \f(CW\&.i\fP are
understood to be preprocessed C source files\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Arguments whose names end in \f(CW\&.C\fP are
understood to be C++ source files (only if \fB-Yc++\fP is specified)\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6

.IP "   \(bu" 6
All other arguments (but particularly those whose names end
in \f(CW\&.o\fP and \f(CW\&.a\fP) are understood to
be binary object files\&.
.PP
The compilation process is as follows\&. Depending on the options
given, it may halt at any stage:
.IP "   1." 6
TDF archives are split into their constituent target independent
capsules\&.
.IP "   2." 6
C source files (including preprocessed C) are compiled into
target independent TDF capsules using \fBtdfc2\fP\fB(1)\fP\&.
(\fBtcpplus\fP\fB(1)\fP does the same for C++ source files when
\fB-Yc++\fP is specified\&.)
.IP "   3." 6
Target independent TDF capsules are linked, using
\fBtld\fP\fB(1)\fP, with the TDF libraries to produce target dependent
TDF capsules\&.
.IP "   4." 6
Target dependent TDF capsules are translated into assembly source
files using one of \fBmipstrans\fP\fB(1)\fP (q\&.v\&. - things are not quite
so simple in this case), \fBtrans386\fP\fB(1)\fP etc\&.
.IP "   5." 6
Assembly source files are compiled into binary object files using
\fBas\fP\fB(1)\fP\&.
.IP "   6." 6
Binary object files are linked with the precompiled libraries,
using \fBld\fP\fB(1)\fP, to produce a final executable\&.
.PP
With the exception of binary object files, intermediate files are
not preserved unless explicitly instructed\&.
.PP
The standard file suffixes \fIc\fP,
\fIi\fP, \fIC\fP, \fII\fP,
\fIj\fP, \fIt\fP, \fIs\fP,
\fIS\fP,
\fIo\fP, \fId\fP, \fIk\fP,
and \fIK\fP, together with \fIp\fP (pretty-printed TDF capsule) and \fIpl\fP (PL_TDF source
file), are used to indicate file types in some options\&. Also the
various compilation phases are identified by letters in some options\&.
These are:
.IP "\fIc\fP" 5
C to TDF producer
.IP "\fIp\fP" 5
C preprocessor
.IP "\fIx\fP" 5
C++ to TDF producer (only if \fB-Yc++\fP is
specified)
.IP "\fIg\fP" 5
C++ preprocessor (only if \fB-Yc++\fP is
specified)

.IP "\fIe\fP" 5
Compact-output error reporter (only if
\fB-Ycompact\fP is specified)
.IP "\fIu\fP" 5
TenDRA dump file linker
.IP "\fId\fP" 5
TDF pretty-printer
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported by \fBtcc\fP\&. All
options are scanned before input files are dealt with\&. The system
variable \fITCCOPTS\fP may be used to specify a list of
options which are processed before the first command-line option\&.
.IP "\fB-A\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Asserts the predicate \fIstring\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-B\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Passed to the system linker\&. The valid values of
\fIstring\fP are target dependent\&.
.IP "\fB-C\fP" 5
Not implemented and provided for \fBcc\fP\fB(1)\fP compatibility only\&. It is meant to preserve comments when
preprocessing\&.
.IP "\fB-D\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Where \fIstring\fP is of the form
\fImacro\fP or \fImacro=defn\fP, is
equivalent to inserting the preprocessor directives "#define
\fImacro\fP 1" or "#define \fImacro
defn\fP" at the start of each C source file\&. This is
implemented by \fBtcc\fP writing this directive into a
start-up file\&.
.IP "\fB-E\fP" 5
Invokes the C preprocessor only, putting the result into a
file with a \f(CW\&.i\fP suffix if other options indicate
that preprocessed C files are to be preserved, or onto the standard
output otherwise\&. Similarly, C++ source files are preprocessed and
put into files with \f(CW\&.I\fP suffixes\&.
.IP "\fB-E\fP\fIletter\fP\fI:\fP\fIfile\fP" 5
Causes \fIfile\fP to be invoked as the
executable for the compilation stage given by
\fIletter\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-F\fP\fIletter\fP" 5
Tells \fBtcc\fP to stop after producing the
files indicated by \fIletter\fP, and to preserve
these files\&. \fIletter\fP is a single character
corresponding to the suffix of the files to be preserved\&.
.IP "\fB-G\fP" 5
Provided for \fIcc\fP compatibility\&.
.IP "\fB-H\fP" 5
Causes the names of files included by a \&'#include\&' directive
to be printed\&.
.IP "\fB-I\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Tells the producers and preprocessors to search the directory
\fIstring\fP for included files\&. The directories are
searched in the order given, followed by the system default
directories\&.
.IP "\fB-J\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Tells the TDF linker to search the directory
\fIstring\fP for TDF libraries\&. The linker searches
the directories in the order given, followed by the system default
directories\&.
.IP "\fB-K\fP\fIstring\fP\fI,\&.\&.\&.\fP" 5
Provided for \fIcc\fP compatibility\&. Specifies
various installer options\&.
.IP "\fB-L\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Tells the system linker to search the directory
\fIstring\fP for libraries\&. It searches the
directories in the order given, followed by the system default
directories\&.
.IP "\fB-M\fP" 5
Specifies that the TDF linker should link all the given
target independent TDF capsules into one\&. This is done between
stages 2 and 3 above\&. The default name for the produced capsule is
\fIa\&.j\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-MA\fP" 5
Specifies that the TDF linker should link all the given
target independent TDF capsules into one and also hide all the
defined tag and token names from the resultant TDF (except the tag
"main")\&. This should only be used to compile complete programs\&. The
default name for the resulting capsule is
\fIa\&.j\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-N\fP\fIidentifier\fP:\fIstring\fP" 5
As \fB-I\fP\fIstring\fP except that the identifier \fIidentifier\fP is
associated with the directory \fIstring\fP in the
producer\&.
.IP "\fB-O\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
This flag has no effect other than to cancel any previous
diagnostics flag and is included only for compatibility with other
compilers\&. All TDF optimisations are on by default\&. All
optimisations are believed to be correct, any bug which occurs in
the fully-optimised state is a genuine bug\&.
.IP "\fB-P\fP" 5
Invokes the C preprocessor only, putting the result into a
file with a \f(CW\&.i\fP suffix\&. The C++ preprocessor is
similarly invoked for C++ source files, putting the result into a
file with a \f(CW\&.I\fP suffix\&.
.IP "\fB-P\fP\fIletter\fP\&.\&.\&." 5
Tells \fBtcc\fP to preserve those files
indicated by \fIletter\fP\&. Each
\fIletter\fP is a single character corresponding to
the suffix of the files to be preserved\&. The \fBtcc\fP startup-file can be preserved as \fItcc_startup\&.h\fP using \fB-Ph\fP\&. All intermediate files can be preserved
using \fB-Pa\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-S\fP" 5
Tells \fBtcc\fP to stop after producing an
assembly source file\&. This is equivalent to
\fB-Fs\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-S\fP\fIletter\fP\fI,\fP\fIstring\fP\fI,\fP\&.\&.\&." 5
The specifies that the list of input files
\fIstring\fP all have type
\fIletter\fP, where \fIletter\fP is a
single character giving the normal suffix of the file type\&. This
gives an alternative method of passing input files to
\fBtcc\fP, one which does not depend on it having to
recognise suffixes to find the type of a file\&.
.IP "\fB-S\fP\fIletter\fP\fI:\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Similar to the option above, but specifies a single input
file, \fIstring\fP (which may contain a
comma)\&.
.IP "\fB-U\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Is equivalent to inserting the preprocessor directive "#undef
\fIstring\fP" at the start of each C source file\&.
This is implemented by \fBtcc\fP writing this
directive into a start-up file\&. The only macros built into the C to
TDF producer are __LINE__ , __FILE__ , __DATE__ , __TIME__ ,
__STDC__ , __ANDF__ and __TenDRA__ \&.
.IP "\fB-V\fP" 5
Causes all tools invoked by \fBtcc\fP to print
their version numbers\&.
.IP "\fB-W\fP\fIletter\fP\fI,\fP\fIstring\fP\fI,\fP\&.\&.\&." 5
This passes the list of options \fIstring\fP to the compilation phase indicated by
\fIletter\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-W\fP\fIletter\fP\fI:\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Similar to the option above, but specifies a single option
\fIstring\fP (which may contain a comma)\&.
.IP "\fB-X\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Specifies a compilation mode\&. \fIstring\fP can
be \fIa\fP for "lenient ANSI",
\fIc\fP for "strict ANSI" (this is default),
\fIp\fP for "strict ANSI with some extra checks",
\fIs\fP for "strict ANSI with many extra checks" or
\fIt\fP for "traditional"\&.
.IP "\fB-X:\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Specifies an individual compilation option\&. See the
\fItcc User\&'s Guide\fP for details\&.
.IP "\fB-Y\fP\fIfile\fP" 5
Specifies the environment to use\&. An environment is a file
telling \fBtcc\fP to modify its defaults\&. If the full
pathname of \fIenv\fP is not given, the file is
searched for along the \fBtcc\fP environments path
which is a list of directories separated by colons\&. This search
path can be printed using \fB-show_env\fP\&. There are
certain standard environments, for example,
\fIansi\fP, representing the ANSI API (this is the
default API environment), \fIposix\fP represents the
POSIX API, \fIxpg3\fP the XPG3 API, and so on\&. The
\fIsystem\fP environment allows
\fBtcc\fP to behave like \fBcc\fP\fB(1)\fP, using the
system header files etc\&. See the \fItcc User\&'s
Guide\fP and \fBtccenv\fP\fB(5)\fP manual page for more
details about environments\&.
.IP "\fB-Z\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Provided for \fBcc\fP\fB(1)\fP compatibility\&. Specifies
various installer options\&.
.IP "\fB-b\fP" 5
Stops the library \fIlibc\&.a\fP being used by
the linker by default\&.
.IP "\fB-c\fP" 5
Tells \fBtcc\fP to stop after producing the
binary object files\&. This is equivalent to
\fB-Fo\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-cc\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to invoke \fBcc\fP\fB(1)\fP for
its code production, using the C to TDF producer as a checking
front-end to \fIcc\fP\&. This allows the checking
capabilities of the front-end of the TDF compiler to be exploited
on machines where no TDF back-end is available\&.
.IP "\fB-cc_only\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to invoke \fBcc\fP\fB(1)\fP only\&.
.IP "\fB-ch\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to emulate the stand-alone
static checker, \fBtchk\fP\fB(1)\fP\&. Intermodular checks are enabled
in this mode\&.
.IP "\fB-d\fP" 5
Halts the compilation after the creation of the dump files\&.
This is equivalent to \fB-Fd\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-disp\fP" 5
Runs the TDF pretty-printer on all files at stage 2 or 3 and
then terminates\&. The results are put into files with
\f(CW\&.p\fP suffixes\&.
.IP "\fB-disp_t\fP" 5
Runs the pretty-printer on all files at stage 3 and then
terminates\&. This differs from the previous option in that it
displays the TDF after linking with the target-dependent TDF
libraries rather than before\&. The output is put into a file with a
\f(CW\&.p\fP suffix\&.
.IP "\fB-dn\fP or \fB-dy\fP" 5
Passed to the system linker\&.
.IP "\fB-do\fP\fIletter\fP \fIstring\fP" 5
Sets the name of the default output file of type
\fIletter\fP to \fIstring\fP\&. For
example, \fB-doh\fP can be used to set the name of the
preserved start-up file\&.
.IP "\fB-dry\fP" 5
Makes \fBtcc\fP print information on what system
commands it would execute with the given files and options (as in
verbose mode) but not actually perform them\&.
.IP "\fB-dump\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to dump its current status\&.
This option is only used during the actual compilation of
\fBtcc\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-e\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Is equivalent to inserting the preprocessor directive
"#include "\fIstring\fP"" at the end of each C
source file\&.
.IP "\fB-f\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Is equivalent to inserting the preprocessor directive
"#include "\fIstring\fP"" at the start of each C
source file\&.
.IP "\fB-g\fP" 5
Tells \fBtcc\fP to produce diagnostic
information compatible with the system debugger\&.
.IP "\fB-h\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Passed to the system linker\&.
.IP "\fB-i\fP" 5
Tells \fBtcc\fP to stop after producing the
target independent TDF capsules\&. This is equivalent to
\fB-Fj\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-im\fP" 5
Enables intermodular checks\&.
.IP "\fB-im0\fP" 5
Disables intermodular checks\&.
.IP "\fB-info\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to print information on the
current API\&.
.IP "\fB-j\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Tells the TDF linker to use the TDF library
\fIstring\fP\f(CW\&.tl\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-k\fP" 5
In intermodular checking mode, halts the compilation after
the creation of C or C++ spec files\&. This is equivalent to
\fB-Fk\fP or \fB-FK\fP (for C++ files)\&.
.IP "\fB-keep_errors\fP" 5
By default, if an error occurs during the production of a
file, \fBtcc\fP will remove it\&. This option will
preserve such files\&.
.IP "\fB-l\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Tells the system linker to use the library
\fIlib\fP\fIstring\fP\f(CW\&.a\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-make_up_names\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to make up names for all
intermediate files rather than forming them from the basenames of
the input files\&.
.IP "\fB-message \fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to print the message
\fIstring\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-nepc\fP" 5
Tells the C to TDF producer to allow certain non-portable
constructs through\&.
.IP "\fB-not_ansi\fP" 5
Tells the C to TDF producer to allow certain non-ANSI
features through\&.
.IP "\fB-no_startup_options\fP" 5
Ensures that no start-up or end-up options are passed to the
C to TDF producer (unlikely to be useful)\&.
.IP "\fB-o \fP\fIstring\fP" 5
If a final executable is produced, call it
\fIstring\fP (the default is
\fIa\&.out\fP)\&. Otherwise, if only one file is
preserved, call it \fIstring\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-p\fP" 5
Produces profiling data for use with \fBprof\fP\fB(1)\fP on
those machines for which this command is available\&.
.IP "\fB-prod\fP" 5
Specifies that \fBtcc\fP should stop after
producing the target independent TDF capsules and combine them into
a TDF archive\&. The default archive name is
\fIa\&.ta\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-q\fP or \fB-quiet\fP" 5
Specifies that \fBtcc\fP should work silently\&.
This is the default\&.
.IP "\fB-query\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to print a list of all the
options it recognises, together with a brief description of each\&.
Since this list is automatically generated it is likely to be more
accurate than this manual page\&.
.IP "\fB-s\fP" 5
Passed to the system linker\&.
.IP "\fB-s\fP\fIletter\fP\fI:\fP\fIsuffix\fP" 5
Specifies that files with suffix \fIsuffix\fP are interpreted as having type indicated by
\fIletter\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-show_env\fP" 5
Prints the \fBtcc\fP environments path\&. This is
a list of directories separated by colons\&. The first element of the
list is always the system default environments directory and the
last element is always the current working directory\&. The other
elements may be specified by the user by means of the
\fITCCENV\fP system variable\&.

No effect (allowed for compatibility with \fBcc\fP\fB(1)\fP on
some systems)\&.
.IP "\fB-temp \fP\fIdir\fP" 5
Specifies that \fBtcc\fP should use
\fIdir\fP as its temporary directory\&.
.IP "\fB-tidy\fP" 5
Causes \fBtcc\fP to remove its intermediate
files when they are no longer required rather than waiting to the
end of the compilation\&.
.IP "\fB-time\fP" 5

commands it is executing (as with verbose mode) followed by the
time taken for each\&.
.IP "\fB-u\fP\fIstring\fP" 5
Passed to the system linker\&.
.IP "\fB-v\fP or \fB-verbose\fP" 5

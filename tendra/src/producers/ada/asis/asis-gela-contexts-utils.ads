--  Purpose:
--  Actual work of building AST starts here.

package Asis.Gela.Contexts.Utils is

   procedure Read_File_And_Supporters
     (The_Context : in out Concrete_Context_Node);
   --  Main recursive subprogram to process sources.
   --  Name of file to parse is stored in Current_File (The_Context).
   --  Procedure reads a unit, its declaration, parent and withed units,
   --  then runs normalization, name resolution and others passes and adds
   --  resulting Compilation_Unit to Library_Unit_Declarations or to
   --  Compilation_Unit_Bodies

   procedure Parse_Parameters (The_Context : in out Concrete_Context_Node);
   --  Read The_Context.Parameters and configure ASIS

end Asis.Gela.Contexts.Utils;

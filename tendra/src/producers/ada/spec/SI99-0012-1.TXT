!subject Add support for null procedure declarations

!summary

Add support for null procedure declarations in ASIS via boolean queries.

!question

The Amendment (Ada 2005) added a null procedure declaration, should these be
accessible via ASIS? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See summary.)

!wording

Add two new functions to clause 13:

13.xx function Is_Null_Procedure


  function Is_Null_Procedure (Element : in Asis.Element) return Boolean;

    Element specifies the element to query.

    Returns True for a declaration of a procedure or formal procedure that is declared
    as null. 

    Returns False for any other Element including a Nil_Element.

    Expected Element_Kinds:
       A_Declaration
       with expected Declaration_Kinds:
          A_Procedure_Declaration
          A_Formal_Procedure_Declaration

    AASIS Note: A generic procedure cannot be null, while generic formal procedures can
    be null.

13.xx function Is_Abstract_Subprogram


  function Is_Abstract_Subprogram (Element : in Asis.Element) return Boolean;

    Element specifies the element to query.

    Returns True for a declaration of a subprogram or formal subprogram that
    is declared as abstract. 

    Returns False for any other Element including a Nil_Element.

    Expected Element_Kinds:
       A_Declaration
       with expected Declaration_Kinds:
          A_Procedure_Declaration
          A_Function_Declaration
          A_Formal_Procedure_Declaration
          A_Formal_Function_Declaration

    AASIS Note: A generic subprogram cannot be abstract, while generic formal
    subrprograms can be abstract.


Add the following paragraph just before the "Returns A_Pragma ..."
paragraph in 15.27 (Corresponding_Body):

Returns A_Nil_Element for a null procedure or an abstract procedure.


!discussion

For the original suggestion from Sergey Rybin see the appendix.
Another idea suggested extending the declarations_kinds to include 
A_Null_Procedure_Declaration. Discussion at the Porto and Albuquerque 
meetings suggested that a null proceduree should be handled in a manner 
similar to abstract subprograms. As it was decided not to
update the trait_kinds to accomodate abstract subprograms, the abstract
characteristic of an element is determined by a has_abstract query
that would return true for declarations that include the abstract keyword.

The original SI suggested adding this capability via an extension to Trait kinds. 
As trait_kinds were decided to be made obsolescent (See SI-0022-1), the trait kind
extension approach is not appropriate.

We have added a Is_Abstract_Subprogram so that null procedures and abstract subprograms
are treated consistently. Has_Abstract could have been used, but that will give
a different answer for abstract types than Is_Abstract_Subprogram does.

Subject: Summary of the proposals for updating the ASIS Standard for Ada 2005
From: Sergey I. Rybin
Date: Mon, 13 Feb 2006 13:55:06 +0300

Formally the ASIS revision process is supposed to be started only after
finishing all the technical work with the new revision of the Ada Standard,
but I think we can start some preliminary technical work with new ASIS
definition already now (all the changes in Ada definition are stable
enough to start the ASIS revision).

At AdaCore we have developed a draft version of the new ASIS specification
and most of the proposed changes are already implemented in the latest
version of GNAT/ASIS technology. The attached file contains the summary
of the changes in the ASIS Standard we have made to adopt the new Ada
features. The interesting thing I've realized when working on
our draft of the new ASIS specification is that if we would like
to keep the upward compatibility as much as possible and if we
would like to keep changes as small as possible,
the new Ada definition gives us very limited freedom in making changes
in the ASIS spec. It does not mean that we think that our proposals
are the only possible solution for ASIS 2005, but it gives us some
hope that we can do ASIS revision for Ada 2005 fast enough.

There is quite a natural mapping of the proposed changes in the ASIS
specification onto the existing set of Ada Issues used for Ada revision,
and the attached file is structured and ordered by AIs. The only
exception is the new values in the ASIS Element Classification needed
to represent the new Ada 2005 predefined attributes and pragmas (of course,
this could be also mapped onto AIs, but I do not think that it would make
sense, because this is the easiest and completely straightforward part
of the ASIS revision).

My main goal of sending this ASIS 2005 Draft summary is to start
the ASIS 2005 discussion. The document itself would hardly be a convenient
background for this discussion - we will have at least split it on
changes related to different language issues, we will also have to
find a way for documenting the revision discussion, probably we
may need a separate mailing list for it. But let's get started!

.....

----------------------------
-- AI-348 Null procedures --
----------------------------
RM-06 6.7

* Extend existing element classification:
  - Add new value to Asis.Declaration_Kinds:
      A_Null_Procedure_Declaration

***> Note that for Asis.Declarations.Names, it was determined to already 
be A_Definition and thus did not need to be added.

* Add A_Null_Procedure_Declaration to the list of appropriate kinds for the
  query Asis.Declarations.Names and Asis.Declarations.Parameter_Profile;

	<title>Limitations</title>

	<para>The main limitations in the current version of <code>tnc</code> are
		as follows:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>There is no error recovery,</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>There is no support for foreign sorts,</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>The support for tokenised tokens is limited and undocumented.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>In addition, far more of the checks (scopes, shape checking, checking
		of consistency of declarations and definitions etc.) are implemented
		for <emphasis>read</emphasis> mode rather than <emphasis>decode</emphasis> mode. To shape check
		a &tdf; capsule, it will almost certainly be more effective to translate
		it into text and check that.</para>

	<para>Another limitation is that the scoping rules for local tags do not
		allow such tags to be accessed outside their scopes using <code>env_offset</code>.</para>

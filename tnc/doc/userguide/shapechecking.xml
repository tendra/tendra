	<title>Shape checking</title>

	<para>The input in <emphasis>read</emphasis> (and to a lesser extent <emphasis>decode</emphasis>) mode
		is checked for shape correctness if the <emphasis>-check</emphasis> or <emphasis>-c</emphasis>
		flag is passed to <code>tnc</code>. This is not guaranteed to pick
		up all shape errors, but is better than nothing.</para>

	<para>When in <emphasis>write</emphasis> mode the results of the shape checking may be
		viewed by passing the <emphasis>-cv</emphasis> flag to <code>tnc</code>. Each expression
		is associated with its shape by means of the:</para>

	<programlisting language="tnc">( exp_with_shape exp shape ) -&gt; exp</programlisting>

	<para>pseudo-construct. Unknown shapes are indicated by <code>....</code></para>
